1. [Number Guesser](https://github.com/areumhan0423/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/main/Number%20Guesser.py)
This is a simple game to guess a randomly generated number by using the while loop.
Once you assign the number for the top of the range, you can make your guess, which will be counted.
It also tells you whether your guess was bigger or smaller than the target number.

2. [Quiz Game](https://github.com/areumhan0423/Mini-Python-Projects/blob/main/Quiz%20Game.py)
